# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section

![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with single introductory section](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

#### Mobile (iphone 6/6s)

#### Desktop (hp EliteBook)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### Continued development

While working on future projects I would like giving a boost to my responsive web design skills as well as improving the accessibilty of the design.
